			<h1>About Us</h1>
			For over 25 years, Access, a Value Added Reseller has been providing technology solutions to solve business problems. Situated in mid Toronto, Access supports small to medium size companies in the GTA and large companies across Canada. Over the years, Access has developed expertise in providing IT solutions to such industries as: professional services, financial services, distribution, manufacturing, non-profit, retail, insurance, printing, graphics, medical and various public institutions.

			As one of Canada’s leading IT resellers, it’s success and growth can be attributed to its consultative approach, its strong technical team and its focus on ensuring superior customer satisfaction.

			We build long lasting partnerships with our customers and our suppliers.

			We consult closely with our clients to first understand the current business problems and potential future needs. We design the technical solution, ensure proper implementation in a timely and cost-effective manner and provide training and on-going support so that our customers can focus on growing their business

			Access works closely with our IT partners to stay abreast of the latest technology.

			Access has been recognized for several years as a 50 Best Managed Solution Provider in Canada, as a CDN Top 100 Solution provider in Canada and as a Pioneer 250 MSP in North America by CRN. Most recently, for 2023, Access was awarded as the GCIS Breakthrough Partner of the Year, and Mark Sutor was awarded the Spirit Award for Canada by Ingram Micro.  Access is a valued member of the Trust X Alliance, a global community of more than 350 solution providers with proven leadership in the IT industry.

			Currently Access is focusing its activities in these major areas:

			 

			<h2>IT solutions for small and medium business</h2>

			For many small businesses in the Ontario, Access has become a trusted advisor and partner for all business technology. We provide the right IT equipment, knowledge, and services that are required to run an efficient and profitable small enterprise. We can provide servers, workstation, networking, cabling, internet connectivity, telephony, business software, collaboration software, email, cloud services, web development, websites, and so on. And we keep it all running efficiently with an onsite or remote & onsite support agreement and proactive monitoring.

			Most of our customers have between 5 and 75 employees and have limited or no internal IT staff. They come from a broad spectrum of industries including manufacturing, distribution and professional services.

			Our customers buy from us because of our approach. We sit down with ownership or key management, try to understand your business and its challenges, and propose a package of equipment, services, and support that solve your key issues. We don’t expect you to be experts in IT. We will talk your language, the language of business. Many of our customers see us as trusted advisors, as an extension of their business. Are you ready for a new relationship with your IT partner?

			 

			<h2>Disc publishing</h2>

			Over the past 2 decades, Access has developed a unique set of solutions for disc publishing.

			On the surface, when you hear the word disc, you might think about older technology.  But, we sell technically advanced disc production equipment… meaning that the machines can produce unique CD, DVD, and Blu-ray Discs, at high throughput.  Each disc can have different data content, and surface printing.

			Over the years we have serviced many industries, such as banking and finance, medical records, video production, law enforcement, national defence, funeral services, and more.  Today, our primary customers are in the banking, law enforcement, and medical fields.

			Our banking customers use our systems to archive data for log term storage.  Archival CDs can last for many decades… up to a century!  And with our 24×7 onsite support revives, we are able to meet the challenges of their SLAs.

			Our law enforcement customers are able to take advantage of the technology to make secure copies of evidence for court.  And similarly, our medical customers can make secure, inexpensive copies of patient tests and records.

			Access is one of the only companies in Canada to specialize in short run disc production for these industries.  As the premier Rimage partner in Canada, you can trust Access to find the right disc solution for your needs.

			 

			<h2>Data room power and cooling</h2>

			Through key partnerships with APC, Eaton, and Liebert, Access provides complete infrastructure solutions for small and large data centers.  We design, build, and support data room power backup, power distribution, racking, airflow, and air conditioning solutions.  Everything needed to support server workloads.

			Our customers tend to be large enterprise customers in the areas of insurance, finance, municipal government, police, manufacturing and engineering.

			Our trained experts help our customers maximize the life expectancy of the data room infrastructure, by recommending the right support service.  We determine the best mixture of extended warranty, battery replacement, chassis refurbishment, and new equipment to keep the power infrastructure running for a decade or more.

			Our customers buy from us because of our deep understanding of their needs.  It can be very difficult to determine the right equipment or support options.  We make it easy!  We are also very sensitive to the mission-critical nature or a data room, and we ensure that we comply with health and safety, privacy, and security policies of our clients.

			 

			<h2>Procurement for large corporations</h2>

			Access helps many large enterprise customers acquire the IT products and services that they require.  Access helps these clients source both standard and hard-to-find IT products… to be delivered on time and on budget.

			Our customers are large, enterprise customers who have internal resources for deployment.

			Although many of our customers could acquire the same products directly from distribution, they find that it is more efficient and cost effective to use our purchasing power.

			We maintain the authorizations and certifications needed to purchase and support the IT products.  We can negotiate special pricing with the manufacturer on their behalf, and manage the delivery of goods… so that they arrive right on time!

			<h2>Software solutions for Large Format & Digital printing</h2>

			Between 1993 and 2015, under the name Access Imaging, Access was. an innovator and a pioneer in the area of wide-format printing equipment.  Today, we leverage that knowledge and understanding of wide-format printing to provide colour management, production workflow, accounting solutions for the digital printing industry.

			Our customers are small and medium size print shops, with wide-format, grand format, screen, offset, and digital small format printing capabilities.

			Through key partnerships with GMG and Printfactory, we help our customers colour manage the entire shop, save ink, and become more efficient.  We can visually match different print technologies and maintain colour consistency over time.  We can also provide colour accurate proofing and mock-up creation.

			Our customers buy from us because we understand how to use technology to solve their production problems.  Our customers need us to focus on their software and IT needs, so that they can print!

		<div class="history">
			History
			Access Computer Solutions was formed in 1992 with the acquisition of APL Computers. It was a small group focusing on providing microcomputer systems to small companies including on-site support and business software solutions.

			The company then transformed itself by focusing on the new printing technologies (lasers, inkjets and colour) and the new personal computers and Novell networks. We also became a Business Vision partner supplying the new accounting software to our clients. We were the first Canadian supplier of the new robotic disc publishing system made by Rimage Corporation.

			About the same time Access Imaging was formed to focus on the new digital graphics innovations. Lasermaster introduced a 12×19 laser printer whose images were used to create printing plates. Soon after it introduced the first 36inch graphic inkjet plotter with a bulk ink system. This product revolutionized the sign industry.

			Access Computer Solutions continued growing by embracing Microsoft network software and providing server-based system solutions. The internet was at its infancy, but we pioneered website creation based on IBM Websphere software. We expanded into the world of ERP solutions by becoming a Macola partner and as an IBM AS400 solution promoter.  Our customers were mainly manufacturing and distribution companies.

			Access Imaging grew significantly by introducing to Canada all the new products from Colorspan for the wide format digital industry. It became the largest supplier of Colorspan printing solutions in Canada for many years.  Colorspan became the world leader in selling UV ink flat bed printers. In 2007, Hewlett Packard purchased Colorspan and other companies in the industrial wide format digital space.

			Access Computer Solutions continued to build its base of small to medium customers and developed into a total IT supplier. We provided hardware, software, printers, internet, web sites, business software and more. Access technical group provided both remote and on-site support. We took care of our customer’s business problems so that they could focus on managing their business.

			In 2011, Access Group Inc was formed by amalgamating Access Imaging and Access Computer Solutions which became operational groups.

			Access Imaging continued its growth as an Elite partner with HP.  By adding several complementary products such as RIPs and finishing equipment and by expanding into Montreal and Calgary, we became the leading supplier to the Large Format Printing industry in Canada. In 2015, we sold the Access Imaging division to Grimco Canada.

			Access then focused on growing the IT business which has been recognized as a Canadian Top100 Solution Provider and a Top 50 Best Managed IT Company.

			Currently Access is focusing its activities in these major areas:

			IT solutions for small and medium business
			Disc publishing
			Data room power and cooling
			Procurement for large corporations

			<h2>Solutions / Technology we provide</h2>
			We help our customers transition to cloud services for better flexibility, reliability, and scalability. Our customers achieve better collaboration and communication, business continuity and security, while using their operating budget.
			This includes Office365, Microsoft Azure Cloud Infrastructure, Accounting & Enterprise Management, Remote Backup & Business Continuity, Hosted Phone Systems, Website & Web-app development & E-commerce.

			<h3>Office365</h3>
			Microsoft Office 365 is built for your business.
			It’s the Office you know, plus tools to help you work better together, so you can get more done — anytime, anywhere.

			Microsoft Office in the cloud, you can work from anywhere with your go-to applications—Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, OneNote, and Publisher. Your recent documents are always right up front, so you can start working fast. And with 1 TB of online storage with OneDrive for Business, you always have the files you need and you can easily share them.

			<h3>Microsoft Azure – Cloud Infrastructure</h3>
			Introduction to cloud computing
			Cloud computing is when you access computing services—like servers, storage, networking, software—over the internet (“the cloud”) from a provider like Microsoft Azure. For example, instead of storing personal documents and photos on your personal computer’s hard drive, most people now store them online: that’s cloud computing.

			Cloud computing platforms, like Microsoft Azure, tend to be less expensive and more secure, reliable, and flexible than on-premises servers. With the cloud, equipment downtime due to maintenance, theft, or damage is almost non-existent. You can scale your compute and storage resources—up or down—almost instantly when your needs change on Microsoft Azure. Also, you typically pay only for the services you use, which provides a level of convenience and cost-control that’s almost impossible to achieve with on-site infrastructure.

			What is Microsoft Azure?
			Microsoft Azure is an ever-expanding set of cloud computing services to help your organization meet its business challenges. Microsoft Azure gives you the freedom to build, manage, and deploy applications on a massive, global network using your preferred tools and frameworks. With Microsoft Azure, you can:

			Be future-ready with Microsoft Azure
			Continuous innovation from Microsoft supports your development today—and your product visions for tomorrow. Build on the latest advancements in the cloud, including more than 1,000 new capabilities released in the last year.

			Operate hybrid seamlessly
			On-premises, in the cloud, and at the edge—Microsoft Azure meets you where you are. Integrate and manage your environments with tools and services designed for hybrid cloud.

			Build on your terms
			You have choices—with Microsfot Azure’s commitment to open source and support for all languages and frameworks, you’re free to build how you want and deploy where you want.

			Trust your cloud
			Get security from the ground up—backed by a team of experts and proactive, industry-leading compliance that’s trusted by enterprises, governments, and startups.

			It is secure
			Security is a given in the cloud industry, but Microsoft Azure’s proactive approach to security, compliance, and privacy is unique. Microsoft leads the industry in establishing and consistently meeting clear security and privacy requirements.

			Azure is global
			With datacenters in more regions than any other cloud provider, Microsoft Azure provides a global reach with local presence that many businesses and organizations need, allowing them to reduce the cost, the time, and the complexity of operating a global infrastructure while meeting local data residency needs.

			It is the future
			Simultaneously, the cloud is evolving from being the integration of on-premises datacenters with the public cloud, to becoming units of computing that are accessible even in the world’s most remote destinations.

			By bringing these two new realities together—and with artificial intelligence running across all systems—we have entered the era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge.

			The intelligent edge is a continually expanding set of connected systems and devices that gather and analyze data—close to your users, the data, or both. Users get real-time insights and experiences, delivered by highly responsive and contextually aware apps.

			<h3>Accounting & Enterprise Management</h3>
			Sage 300 ERP  business management

			Cloud PBX Phone system
			Cloud-Based Phone System Features and Benefits
			Replace your outdated on-premise office phone system with a less expensive, more flexible, and feature-rich cloud communications platform.

			What is a cloud phone system?
			A cloud-based phone system is a business communications solution that is hosted and maintained in the provider’s data centers—not at your office—and is delivered through your internet connection. It features a hosted PBX capability, which has the same routing and call management features of a traditional PBX while using voice over IP (VoIP) to facilitate calls over the internet.

			It also has other capabilities that traditional office phone systems don’t or can’t offer at affordable prices, like long-distance calling. This cloud solution is often offered as a service, so smaller businesses are able to subscribe to it instead of investing heavily on an expensive on-premise system.


			The cloud phone system changed the way companies manage calls and even do business.
			Thanks to the system being hosted remotely, companies are able to enjoy the myriad of benefits and advantages that a traditional on-premise PBX setup fails to offer.

			Cloud-hosted phone systems
			No expensive, bulky hardware that require a dedicated room
			Quick installation and setup—it just takes minutes
			Works with IP phones, desk computers, and mobile devices
			No cables needed to install; uses virtual phone extensions
			Updates and upgrades are automatically rolled out to all subscribers
			Does not require maintenance from dedicated personnel
			Changes to the account can be done instantly
			RingCentral: The cloud communications solution for every business
			A flexible and mobile cloud communications platform

			For businesses with multiple locations and dispersed workforces

			A cloud phone system serves all locations and your entire workforce by centralizing all your communication channels in one cloud platform, delivered via the internet. With this, all employees from every location—including home offices and workers on the go—share the same robust features from a single unified business phone system. RingCentral also makes it easy to communicate however you want, including through:

			Business phone numbers: Choose from toll-free, local, and even international phone numbers. You can even add virtual phone extensions, which can be accessed from anywhere and on any device, not just on the assigned desk phone.
			Online meetings: Host and join video conferences with screen sharing.
			Team messaging: Message, assign tasks, and share files to your teammates on one platform.
			What’s even better is that you can do all these from anywhere in the world through the RingCentral unified app for PCs and Mac® or for mobile Android™ or iOS® devices.

			A scalable virtual phone system
			Get a phone system that grows as your business grows. Through an online administration dashboard, you can easily purchase, activate, and assign business phone numbers and virtual extensions to new users or departments. No need to wait for the provider to install new cables and other hardware to have the changes implemented. All it takes is a couple of clicks on your computer or a few taps on your mobile device to get it done instantly.

			<h3>Website & Web App Development & e-Commerce</h3>
			For many years, Access has developed custom web applications for our clients.  These include tools for internal business use, as well as public-facing applications such as e-commerce and customer order tracking.

			We help our customers take full advantage of the internet to grow their business. Together we develop a plan that best suits their needs. Access will develop the web application, host it in your private or public cloud, and train key users on routine processing and maintenance.

			In particular,  we have developed significant expertise with the automation of data harmonization and import.  Many of our customers are challenged by the need to import data from multiple vendors and multiple formats into ERP or web database systems. 

			We have developed logic and automation routines to ease the workload associated with processing, in some case, tens of thousands of vendors SKUs and associated data.  This has included artificial intelligence to produce auto-categorization for web.

			We have also experienced with customer projects where data needs to be exchanged between front end systems (like websites) and backend systems (like internal ERP or production systems).  These connector-type routines are commonly known as ‘middleware’.

			Here are some examples of the type of applications that we have developed:
			E-commerce websites
			Customer order tracking on line
			Inventory status on line
			On-line ordering capability
			Employee shift scheduling
			Upload all current products and pricing  
			Auto-creation of web categorization
			Automation for pricing updates
			Accounting and invoicing integration

			We are experienced with tools such as:
			Rave7 CMS
			WordPress
			Excel VBA macros and pivot tables
			XML
