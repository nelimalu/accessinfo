			Currently Access is focusing its activities in these major areas:

			 

			<h2>IT solutions for small and medium business</h2>

			For many small businesses in the Ontario, Access has become a trusted advisor and partner for all business technology. We provide the right IT equipment, knowledge, and services that are required to run an efficient and profitable small enterprise. We can provide servers, workstation, networking, cabling, internet connectivity, telephony, business software, collaboration software, email, cloud services, web development, websites, and so on. And we keep it all running efficiently with an onsite or remote & onsite support agreement and proactive monitoring.

			Most of our customers have between 5 and 75 employees and have limited or no internal IT staff. They come from a broad spectrum of industries including manufacturing, distribution and professional services.

			Our customers buy from us because of our approach. We sit down with ownership or key management, try to understand your business and its challenges, and propose a package of equipment, services, and support that solve your key issues. We don’t expect you to be experts in IT. We will talk your language, the language of business. Many of our customers see us as trusted advisors, as an extension of their business. Are you ready for a new relationship with your IT partner?

			 

			<h2>Disc publishing</h2>

			Over the past 2 decades, Access has developed a unique set of solutions for disc publishing.

			On the surface, when you hear the word disc, you might think about older technology.  But, we sell technically advanced disc production equipment… meaning that the machines can produce unique CD, DVD, and Blu-ray Discs, at high throughput.  Each disc can have different data content, and surface printing.

			Over the years we have serviced many industries, such as banking and finance, medical records, video production, law enforcement, national defence, funeral services, and more.  Today, our primary customers are in the banking, law enforcement, and medical fields.

			Our banking customers use our systems to archive data for log term storage.  Archival CDs can last for many decades… up to a century!  And with our 24×7 onsite support revives, we are able to meet the challenges of their SLAs.

			Our law enforcement customers are able to take advantage of the technology to make secure copies of evidence for court.  And similarly, our medical customers can make secure, inexpensive copies of patient tests and records.

			Access is one of the only companies in Canada to specialize in short run disc production for these industries.  As the premier Rimage partner in Canada, you can trust Access to find the right disc solution for your needs.

			 

			<h2>Data room power and cooling</h2>

			Through key partnerships with APC, Eaton, and Liebert, Access provides complete infrastructure solutions for small and large data centers.  We design, build, and support data room power backup, power distribution, racking, airflow, and air conditioning solutions.  Everything needed to support server workloads.

			Our customers tend to be large enterprise customers in the areas of insurance, finance, municipal government, police, manufacturing and engineering.

			Our trained experts help our customers maximize the life expectancy of the data room infrastructure, by recommending the right support service.  We determine the best mixture of extended warranty, battery replacement, chassis refurbishment, and new equipment to keep the power infrastructure running for a decade or more.

			Our customers buy from us because of our deep understanding of their needs.  It can be very difficult to determine the right equipment or support options.  We make it easy!  We are also very sensitive to the mission-critical nature or a data room, and we ensure that we comply with health and safety, privacy, and security policies of our clients.

			 

			<h2>Procurement for large corporations</h2>

			Access helps many large enterprise customers acquire the IT products and services that they require.  Access helps these clients source both standard and hard-to-find IT products… to be delivered on time and on budget.

			Our customers are large, enterprise customers who have internal resources for deployment.

			Although many of our customers could acquire the same products directly from distribution, they find that it is more efficient and cost effective to use our purchasing power.

			We maintain the authorizations and certifications needed to purchase and support the IT products.  We can negotiate special pricing with the manufacturer on their behalf, and manage the delivery of goods… so that they arrive right on time!

			<h2>Software solutions for Large Format & Digital printing</h2>

			Between 1993 and 2015, under the name Access Imaging, Access was. an innovator and a pioneer in the area of wide-format printing equipment.  Today, we leverage that knowledge and understanding of wide-format printing to provide colour management, production workflow, accounting solutions for the digital printing industry.

			Our customers are small and medium size print shops, with wide-format, grand format, screen, offset, and digital small format printing capabilities.

			Through key partnerships with GMG and Printfactory, we help our customers colour manage the entire shop, save ink, and become more efficient.  We can visually match different print technologies and maintain colour consistency over time.  We can also provide colour accurate proofing and mock-up creation.

			Our customers buy from us because we understand how to use technology to solve their production problems.  Our customers need us to focus on their software and IT needs, so that they can print!

			History
			Access Computer Solutions was formed in 1992 with the acquisition of APL Computers. It was a small group focusing on providing microcomputer systems to small companies including on-site support and business software solutions.

			The company then transformed itself by focusing on the new printing technologies (lasers, inkjets and colour) and the new personal computers and Novell networks. We also became a Business Vision partner supplying the new accounting software to our clients. We were the first Canadian supplier of the new robotic disc publishing system made by Rimage Corporation.

			About the same time Access Imaging was formed to focus on the new digital graphics innovations. Lasermaster introduced a 12×19 laser printer whose images were used to create printing plates. Soon after it introduced the first 36inch graphic inkjet plotter with a bulk ink system. This product revolutionized the sign industry.

			Access Computer Solutions continued growing by embracing Microsoft network software and providing server-based system solutions. The internet was at its infancy, but we pioneered website creation based on IBM Websphere software. We expanded into the world of ERP solutions by becoming a Macola partner and as an IBM AS400 solution promoter.  Our customers were mainly manufacturing and distribution companies.

			Access Imaging grew significantly by introducing to Canada all the new products from Colorspan for the wide format digital industry. It became the largest supplier of Colorspan printing solutions in Canada for many years.  Colorspan became the world leader in selling UV ink flat bed printers. In 2007, Hewlett Packard purchased Colorspan and other companies in the industrial wide format digital space.

			Access Computer Solutions continued to build its base of small to medium customers and developed into a total IT supplier. We provided hardware, software, printers, internet, web sites, business software and more. Access technical group provided both remote and on-site support. We took care of our customer’s business problems so that they could focus on managing their business.

			In 2011, Access Group Inc was formed by amalgamating Access Imaging and Access Computer Solutions which became operational groups.

			Access Imaging continued its growth as an Elite partner with HP.  By adding several complementary products such as RIPs and finishing equipment and by expanding into Montreal and Calgary, we became the leading supplier to the Large Format Printing industry in Canada. In 2015, we sold the Access Imaging division to Grimco Canada.

			Access then focused on growing the IT business which has been recognized as a Canadian Top100 Solution Provider and a Top 50 Best Managed IT Company.

			Currently Access is focusing its activities in these major areas:

			IT solutions for small and medium business
			Disc publishing
			Data room power and cooling
			Procurement for large corporations
